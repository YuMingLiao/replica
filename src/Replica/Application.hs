 * Blocking step could be resumed by
   1) internal change, like internal blocking io resumed, or by
   2) dispatched event
 * Event is dispatchable if `Event -> Maybe (IO ())' result is `Just fire'.
 * Event is dispatched only once per frame
 * In rare cases, event might dispatched after the `step' block is already resumed.
   In such case, dispatching shouldn't affect anything.

 * Manage resource(File Handlers, Threads, etc) using ResourceT/MonadResource.

* Network Lag problem:

Every HTML will be render to user with increasing unique id, called FrameID.
Each Event has FrameID attached to them which they occured(evClieentFrame).
Because of the network lag, we some times recieve Events generated from a past view.

Simple solution is to ignore such events and wait for a event generated by the
lastest view. But this will cause poor UI experience for users who has a slow
connection. Things like UI components not responding.

Instead we relax and receive events from past if its dispatchable. Thus the
event fireing function has type:

  Event -> Maybe (IO ())

`Nothing' means the event was undispatchable, meaning it was occured in a past
view, and also there was no corresponding elements in the latest view. `Just ev'
means the event occued by the lastest view, or it was from past, but there was a
correspnding element.

With this approuch, network lag problem is relaxed. But now we have to worry
about the follwing problem.

* Disptaching to a Wrong Element Problem:

-- * Starting Application

{- | Execute the first step. Main purpose is to implement SSR.

Run the application till we get the first view. After we reach first view, the
application is suspended, though there might be threads running if application
invokes them before we reach first view.

(V.HTML, IO Session, IO ())

 * V.HTML      First view
 * IO Session  Continue the suspended appliction and manages it as Session.
 * IO ()       Release the resource acquired by application such as File Handlers/Threads..

Either `IO Session' or `IO ()' must be invoked orelase resrouce will
leak. Later(`IO ()') is for when we want descard this suspended application.

Some additional notes:

 * In rare case, application might not create any VDOM and gracefuly end. In
   such case, `Nothing` is returned.
 * If the application throws exception before we reach the fist view update,
   then the exception is simply raised.
 * Don't execute `fistStep' inside a mask.

Implementation notes:

 * リソース獲得及び解放ハンドラは mask された状態で実行される
 * 全体を onException で囲めないのは Nohting の場合は例外が発生していないが
   `releaseRes` を呼び出さないといけないため。

{- | stepLoop

 Every step starts with showing user the frame. After that we wait for a step to proceed.
 Step could be procceded by either:

   1) Client-side's event, which is recieved as `Event`, or
   2) Server-side event(e.g. io action returning a value)

 Every frame has corresponding `TMVar (Maybe Event)` called `stepedBy`. It is initally empty.
 It is filled whith `Event` when case (1), and filled with `Nothing` when case (2). (※1)
 New frame won't be created and setted before we fill current frame's `stepedBy`.

 ※1 Unfortunatlly, we don't have a garuntee that step was actually procceded by client-side event when
 `stepBy` is filled with `Just Event`. When we receive a dispatchable event, we fill `stepBy`
 before actually firing it. While firing the event, servier-side event could procceed the step.
